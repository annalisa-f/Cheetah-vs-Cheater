                <p><b>This website is our call to action. We know how overwhelming environmental campaigns are. They leave you frustrated, wondering what you can do and feeling helpless. That's why our aim is to constantly update this site with reliable information, and links to sources that allow you to research and find out as much or as little as you want. Our other aim in doing this is to convince you that all is not lost. Peter the Cheetah will continue to evade the businessman as long as we continue to hold him accountable. Don't beat yourself up for what you can't do. Just choose to buy from a more sustainable brand next time you're at the supermarket. Use our research to figure out which brands to avoid, and put your support towards those who are doing the right thing. Happy reading/watching!</b></p>
